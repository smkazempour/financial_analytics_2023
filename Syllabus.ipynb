    "## Instructor\n",
    "Seyed Kazempour\\\n",
    "Email: skazempour@lsu.edu\\\n",
    "Office Hours: Tuesday/Thursday, 14:00 - 15:00\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course Description\n",
    "This course teaches the Python programming language and uses it to address three common problems in Financial Economics. \n",
    "- Meeting time: Monday/Wednesday, 9:00 -10:30\n",
    "- Classroom: Business Building #5412\n",
    "- Website: All course material are available on Canvas. Please contact me if you do not have access.\n",
    "- Textbook: The material tought in class is self-contained. You will not require a textbook for understanding the lecture, doing the assignments, or the exams. If you are interested in going beyond the class material, you can use the multitude of books and courses available online. I find \"Python for Finance: Mastering Data-Driven Finance\" by Yves Hilpisch to be a good reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Goals\n",
    "By the end of this class, you should be able to\n",
    "- understand and code in Python,\n",
    "- read, clean, and manipulate financial data using NumPy and Pandas, \n",
    "- visualize data using Matplotlib and Seaborn,\n",
    "- create portfolios of stocks, and\n",
    "- evaluate investment strategies using time-series regressions.\n",
    "For a more detailed description of the topics covered in this class, refer to the last section.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "You need no programming background for this class. Familiarity with basic tools and concepts of Financial Economics such as returns, portfolios, and regressions helps but is not necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Credit Hour and Engaged Learning Time Expectations \n",
    "LSU’s general policy states that for each credit hour, you should plan to spend about 45 hours of combined “in-class” and “out-of-class\" time working on course related activities such as viewing and interacting with instructional materials, activities and assignments, assigned readings, research, or study time. Therefore, a seven-week, three-credit hour course typically requires around 18–20 hours of student work per week. A sixteen-week, three-credit hour course typically requires around 9 hours of student work per week.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Grading Scheme and Course Work\n",
    "Your final score will be the weighted average of the following components. If you miss an exam, midterm or final, regardless of the reason, I will add the weight of your missed exam to the other one. For example, if you miss the midterm exam, your final score will be 60% $\\times$ Final + 30% $\\times$ Homework + 10% $\\times$ Class participation. I will not, however, administer exams individually.\n",
    "|Component| Weight|\n",
    "|:---:|:---:|\n",
    "|Class participation| 10% |\n",
    "|Homework| 30%|\n",
    "|Midterm | 30%|\n",
    "|Final |30%|\n",
    "\n",
    "I round your average score to the nearest integer (e.g., 94.49 $\\approx$ 94, 95.5 $\\approx$ 96) and assign your letter grades according to the follwing table.\n",
    "|Score|Letter Grade|\n",
    "|:--:|:--:|\n",
    "|98-100|A+|\n",
    "|94-97|A|\n",

    "## Academic Integrity\n",
    "Students must comply with the LSU Code of Student Conduct. Academic misconduct includes but is not limited to cheating, plagiarism, collusion, falsifying academic records, and/or any act designed to give unfair academic advantage to the student. Preventing academic misconduct requires learners to take ownership of their individual work for individual assignments and assessments. Students who violate the LSU Code of Student Conduct will be referred to Student Advocacy & Accountability. For undergraduate students, a first academic violation could result in a zero grade on the assignment or failing the class and disciplinary probation until graduation. For a second academic violation, the result could be suspension from LSU. For graduate students, suspension is the appropriate outcome for the first offense. To read more, please visit [the LSU Code of Student Conduct page](https://www.lsu.edu/saa/students/codeofconduct.php).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Plagiarism\n",
    "It is your responsibility to refrain from plagiarizing the academic property of another and to utilize appropriate citation method for all coursework. Remember, there is a difference between paraphrasing and quoting and how to properly cite each respectively. One tool available to assist you in correct citations is the “References” function in Microsoft Word. This program automatically formats the information you input according to the citation method you select for the document. This program also has the ability to generate a reference or works cited page for your document. The version of Microsoft Word with the “References” function is available in most University computer labs. A demonstration of how to use this tool is available online at [the LSU Student Advocacy & Accountability page](https://www.lsu.edu/saa/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unauthorized Assistance\n",
    "All work must be completed without assistance unless explicit permission for group or partner work is given. This is critical so that we can assess your performance on each assignment. Read the syllabus and assignment directions carefully. When in doubt, e-mail or ask in class. Seeking clarification is your responsibility as a student. Assuming group or partner work is okay without permission constitutes a violation of the LSU Code of Student Conduct.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Netiquette \n",
    "When communicating online (for instance in Moodle discussion groups), communication comes across differently than the communication we are accustomed to through academic writing and face-to-face classroom discussion. Please review the [Online Etiquette Guide](https://public.3.basecamp.com/p/6J6nU8xTs4QjRF9uVyMzE26J) and refer to these guidelines to craft your communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also read [The Core Rules of Netiquette](http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html) by Virginia Shea (1994) to understand the human aspect of online communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accessibility\n",
    "A student with a disability is entitled by law to equal access to university programs. Two federal laws protect persons with disabilities in post-secondary education: the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Pub. L. No. 93-112, as amended), the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act (Pub. L. No. 101-336) and the ADA Amendments Act (Pub. L. No.110-325). LSU A&M is committed to ensuring that its websites, online courses, and all online materials are accessible to people with disabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have accessibility needs that we can help with, visit the [LSU Disability Services page](https://www.lsu.edu/disability/) and register for accommodations before you begin your course work. If there is course material that you find is not accessible, please contact us directly to discuss accommodations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Diversity Statement \n",
    "Diversity is fundamental to LSU's mission and the University is committed to creating and maintaining a living and learning environment that embraces individual difference. Cultural inclusion is of highest priority. LSU recognizes that achieving national prominence depends on the human spirit, participation, and dedicated work of the entire university community. Through its Commitment to Community, LSU strives to create an inclusive, respectful, intellectually challenging climate that embraces individual difference in race, ethnicity, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity/expression, age, spirituality, socioeconomic status, disability, family status, experiences, opinions, and ideas. LSU proactively cultivates and sustains a campus environment that values open dialogue, cooperation, shared responsibility, mutual respect, and cultural competence—the driving forces that enrich and enhance cutting-edge research, first-rate teaching, and engaging community outreach activities.\n",
