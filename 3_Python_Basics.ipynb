In the previous example, I could name the new variable *a*, *touchdownsscored*, or *dweioqeivbnpqceadfcoxqmew*. However, Python variables can only contain alpha-numeric characters as well as underscores, and they must not start with a number. Moreover, Python is a case-sensitive language, meaning its commands and variable names are sensitive to upper-case vs. lower-case spelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve your code's readability, it is a good practice to use meaningful names for your variables. This practice makes life easier for others who would like to understand your code without necessarily executing it, including yourself in the future. Another good practice is using underscores to separate words in variable names, e.g. *touchdowns_scored* instead of *touchdownsscored*. "
