Python is an extensive language with many commands and libraries. We will not cover all of them here. Instead, we focus on the most fundamental tools any programmer needs to know. Future sections introduce a variety of other tools to make coding easier. \n\nTo make this lesson more interesting, let us use Python to analyze some statistics about the LSU Tigers' performance in 2022 season!\n\n## 1. Variables\nLet us start from the most basic coding task: We want to store a numerical value (e.g., how many game LSU Tigers played in 2022) in a variable so we can use it later. In Python, you can do so using the **assignment operator (=)**.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"games_played = 14","metadata":{},"execution_count":13,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"By using the assignment operator, we tell the interpretor to create a variable, call it *games_played*, and store the integer number *14* in it.

In the previous example, I could name the new variable *a*, *touchdownsscored*, or *dweioqeivbnpqceadfcoxqmew*. However, Python variables can only contain alpha-numeric characters as well as underscores, and they must not start with a number. Moreover, Python is a case-sensitive language, meaning its commands and variable names are sensitive to upper-case vs. lower-case spelling.\n\nTo improve your code's readability, it is a good practice to use meaningful names for your variables. This practice makes life easier for others who would like to understand your code without necessarily executing it, including yourself in the future. Another good practice is using underscores to separate words in variable names, e.g. *touchdowns_scored* instead of *touchdownsscored*. ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 1.1.

Booleans are logical variables whose values can only be True (often equivalent to 1 in numerical calculation) or False (equivalent to zero). They are often used for evaluating conditions, which we will discuss in the next section. Finally, the last two variables are strings, a variable type used for storing textual data. In Python, strings are enclosed between single-quotes ('') or double-quotes (\"\").\n\nIn Python, integers, floats, booleans, and strings are the four fundamental data types that build everything else. The interpreter determines each variable's type based on the value assigned to it, repeating this process on every assignment. If you are unsure about avariable's type, you can use the command **type()** to check it.
